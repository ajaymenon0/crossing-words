# Crossing Words

This is gonna start up as a simple react based crossword. Since I love solving crosswords (though I suck at them!).
The idea down the line is to make this a co-op thing so that multiple people can solve a crossword together.
The point being sometimes crosswords, like most things in life, are super fun when multiple people are involved.
The more the merrier right.
Well hold your horses, I'm still looking at building a simple decent looking app before I throw around features like its Black Friday.

Thanks to github user [doshea](https://github.com/doshea/) for the repo [nyt_crosswords](https://github.com/doshea/nyt_crosswords), which is from where I shall be sourcing the sample crosswords now.

### How do I run this now?
The usual
```
npm i
npm start
```
